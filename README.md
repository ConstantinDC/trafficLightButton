The Semaphore Button Project
The theme of the project is to build a web page that contains a button that changes color when clicked. By default the color of the button is "red". On the first clik it should change to "yellow", then at the second click it will be "green" and finally on the third click the color will be "red". And the cycle will repeat! 
The project has 3 components: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
First, I created a blank web page "index.html" in HTML. This page has a single element, a "button" identified by his "id" and also by "onclick" attribute.
In the folder "styles" I created a file "style.css" I linked it with my "index.html" file.
In the folder "scripts" I made a file "main.js". The "onclick" attribute will receive the result of calling the function changeColor(). To change the currentColor of the button I used "if", "else if" statements. I linked the "main.js" file with "index.html" file and that's all!
